#TRASHEE 
"Trashee is a smart waste management platform that rewards users with points for using designated dustbins instead of littering. These points can be redeemed for discounts and perks, making cleanliness a rewarding habit. By gamifying waste disposal, Trashee encourages responsible behavior, fosters cleaner communities, and promotes a greener, more sustainable future."
